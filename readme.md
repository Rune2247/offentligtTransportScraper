# Scraping Public Transport Pages

This was a small Sunday project to explore the feasibility of scraping public transport pages.

## Findings

While scraping price information on a large scale proved to be impractical, it **is possible** to retrieve trip data without pricing details efficiently. This allows for gathering schedules, routes, and other relevant trip information without incurring high costs or impacting the website's performance.

## Conclusion

It is **not feasible** on a large scale due to the necessity of:

- Clicking on individual trips to view prices

However, obtaining trip data **without prices** can be achieved effectively, enabling the collection of essential scheduling and routing information without significant resource investment.

This makes scraping:

- Potentially detrimental to the website's performance when including prices
- Feasible and cost-effective when excluding pricing information
